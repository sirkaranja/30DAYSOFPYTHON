# 30DAYSOFPYTHON

This is an open-source project guide for learning Python Programming Language .

Fork it and create separate branches/folders for each day. 

## Topics Breakdown

### Day 1: Python Basics
Start by installing Python and a text editor. Learn the basics of Python, such as: 
 variables, data types, Math Operators, Comments, Input() function, Print() function, The str(), int(), and float() Functions

#### Exercise
Simple Python Calculator Program: Write a simple program that does basic math operations including addition, subtraction, deletion, division, power, squareroot,etc,. 


# Day 2: Python Control Flow - IF Statements, Logical and Comparator Operations
Learn how to use control flow statements like if-else statements, Switch-Case Statement,Logical Operators (and, OR), Boolean operators and comparisonooperations such as <, >, !==, ==, etc
#### Exercise
You are building a program to help a user decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the current temperature in Fahrenheit and whether it is currently raining or not (as a boolean value), and then suggests an appropriate outfit based on the following criteria:

If the temperature is less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit, suggest wearing a coat, hat, scarf, and gloves. If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a sweater or light jacket. If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a rain jacket and boots. If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a t-shirt and shorts. If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a light jacket and rain boots.

# Day 3: Loops and Iteration in Python
Understand how to apply Loops and iteration in python programs. *** While loops:With boolean values, do-while loop too *** For Loops: Using Indexing,using range(), Using items, looping over sequential data (sets, dictionaries, lists, tuples) *** For-Else statements *** Break and Continue Statements

#### Exercise
Fibonacci: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer n, and then prints the first n Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
# Day 4: Functions In Python
Understand the concept of functions in Python. A function is a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task. They provide better modularity for your application and reuse-ability. A function can take arguments and return values:

#### Exercise
1.write a function in python that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the given numbers. 

2. write a function in python that takes a list of numbers and returns the second-largest item in the list of the given numbers. 

 3. write a function in python that takes 3 parameters: name, age, and occupation and prints this
